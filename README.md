## Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and using the React Todo App. The app is designed to help users manage their tasks by providing a simple and intuitive interface for adding and deleting todo items.

### Components

#### 1. App Component

The `App` component is the main component of the React Todo App. It consists of the following components:

- `Header`: Displays the header of the application.
- `AddTodo`: Provides functionality to add new todo items.
- `Todos`: Displays the list of todo items.
- `Footer`: Displays the footer of the application.

#### 2. AddTodo Component

The `AddTodo` component allows users to add new todo items to the list. It has the following functionality:

- **Input Field:** Users can enter the content of the new todo item.
- **Add Button:** Adds the new todo item to the list when clicked.

#### 3. Header Component

The `Header` component displays the header of the React Todo App. It may include the app name or any other relevant information.

#### 4. Todos Component

The `Todos` component is responsible for rendering the list of todo items. Each todo item is represented by a `TodoItem` component.

#### 5. TodoItem Component

The `TodoItem` component represents an individual todo item. It displays the todo item's content and includes a delete button to remove the item from the list.

#### 6. Footer Component

The `Footer` component displays the footer of the React Todo App. It may include additional information, links, or credits.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
